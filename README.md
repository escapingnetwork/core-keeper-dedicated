## How to run

### ARM based configuration

This image currently includes the following Box64 build variants for the following devices:

- Generic [generic]
- Raspberry Pi 3 [rpi3]
- Raspberry Pi 4 [rpi4-pre3]
- Raspberry Pi 5 (4K page size) [rpi5]
- Raspberry Pi 5 (16K page size) [rpi5_16k]
- M1 (M-Series) Mac [m1]
- ADLink Ampere Altra (Oracle ARM CPUs) [adlink]

By default it is set to use `generic`. If you want to use another one, change the enviromental variable `ARM64_DEVICE` at the `core.env` file.

### Volumes

Create two directories where you want to run your server :

- `server-data`: mandatory if you want to keep configuration between each restart
- `server-files`: optional, contains all the files of the application

Then modify `/host/path/to/server-data` and/or `/host/path/to/server-files` in one of the examples below to match the paths of the folders you created.

### Using Docker CLI:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name core-keeper-dedicated \
  -e WORLD_NAME="Core Keeper Server" \
  -e MAX_PLAYERS=5 \
  -v /host/path/to/server-data:/home/steam/core-keeper-data \
  -v /host/path/to/server-files:/home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated \
  escaping/core-keeper-dedicated:latest
```

### Using Docker Compose
Create a [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose-example/docker-compose.yml) with the following content:

```yml
services:
  core-keeper:
    image: escaping/core-keeper-dedicated:latest
    container_name: core-keeper-dedicated
    restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 2m
    # Port is only needed if using direct connection mode
    # ports:
    #   - "$SERVER_PORT:$SERVER_PORT/udp"
    volumes:
      - /host/path/to/server-files:/home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated
      - /host/path/to/server-data:/home/steam/core-keeper-data
    env_file:
      - path: core.env
        required: false
```

Create a `core.env` file and override the desired environmental variables for the dedicated server, see configuration for reference. Example:
```env
ARM64_DEVICE=rpi5
MAX_PLAYERS=3
```

On the folder which contains the files run `docker compose up -d`.

A `GameID.txt` file will be created next to the executable containing the Game ID. If it doesn't appear you can check the docker logs (`docker logs core-keeper-dedicated` or `docker compose logs`) for errors.

To query the game ID run:
`docker exec -it core-keeper-dedicated cat /home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated/GameID.txt`

## Mod Support

The container supports automatically installing mods from [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/corekeeper).

1. Get a mod.io API key from [mod.io/me/access](https://mod.io/me/access)
    - You'll need the API path that is generated along with the key (e.g. https://u-*.modapi.io/v1)
2. Set the necessary environment variables in your `core.env` file (or in your `docker-compose.yml`)
  - `MODS_ENABLED=true`
  - `MODIO_API_KEY=your_api_key`
  - `MODIO_API_URL=your_api_url`
  - `MODS=mod1,mod2` (see below)

### Specify mods to install

> [!WARNING]
> Installing a client-only mod can cause the server to not start. Don't install client-only mods (they wouldn't do anything on the server anyway).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Mod dependencies are not automatically installed. You must look at the dependencies for each mod you want to install and add their dependencies to the list.

You'll need to get the mod string ID from mod.io for each mod you want to install. The easiest way to do this is to grab it from the URL.

For example, looking at the URL for [CoreLib](https://mod.io/g/corekeeper/m/core-lib) (`https://mod.io/g/corekeeper/m/core-lib`), you would use `core-lib`.

Specify mods as a comma-separated list, optionally providing a version:

```sh
# Format: <mod_id>[:<version>], ...
MODS=core-lib,coreliblocalization,corelibrewiredextension,ck-qol
```

Example using specific versions:

```sh
MODS=core-lib,coreliblocalization,corelibrewiredextension:3.0.1,ck-qol:1.9.4
```

- If `version` is not specified, the latest version will be installed.
- Mods are reinstalled whenever the container is started, so to update mods to their latest version, simply restart the container.

## Network Mode

Currently Core Keeper supports two network modes: SDR (Steam Datagram Relay) and Direct Connect.

### SDR (Steam Datagram Relay)
In this mode, the server uses [Valve's Virtual Network](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/multiplayer/steamdatagramrelay) to route traffic through Steam's relay infrastructure. Instead of players connecting directly to the server's IP address, all communication goes through secure relay nodes managed by Steam. This hides the server’s real IP, protects against DDoS attacks, and improves NAT traversal.

Because of this relay system, server operators do not need to open any ports on their router or firewall—as long as outbound connections to Steam are allowed, the server can communicate with clients reliably.

### Direct Connection
In Direct Connect mode, players connect straight to the server’s public IP address without going through Steam's relay network. This can result in lower latency and more direct communication, but it requires the server to be reachable from the internet.

Server operators must open and forward the necessary ports on their router or firewall to allow incoming connections. Unlike SDR, this mode exposes the server’s IP address to clients and may be more vulnerable to connection issues or attacks.

> [!IMPORTANT]<br>
> The SERVER_PORT environment variable determines the server's network mode.<br>
> Leave it empty to use SDR (no port forwarding needed).<br>
> Setting a value switches to Direct Connect, which requires opening and forwarding ports.<br>
> Only set this if you specifically want Direct Connect.
